	* its a Set that further provides a total ordering on its elements
	* The elements are ordered using their natural ordering, or by a Comparator typically provided at sorted set creation time.

Method and Description
	Comparator<? super E> comparator() - Returns the comparator used to order the elements in this set, or null if this set uses the natural ordering of its elements.
	
	E	first() - Returns the first (lowest) element currently in this set.
	
	SortedSet<E> headSet(E toElement) - Returns a view of the portion of this set whose elements are strictly less than toElement.
	
	E last() - Returns the last (highest) element currently in this set.
	
	default Spliterator<E> spliterator() - Creates a Spliterator over the elements in this sorted set.
	
	SortedSet<E> subSet(E fromElement, E toElement) - Returns a view of the portion of this set whose elements range from fromElement, inclusive, to toElement, exclusive.
	
	SortedSet<E> tailSet(E fromElement) - Returns a view of the portion of this set whose elements are greater than or equal to fromElement.
